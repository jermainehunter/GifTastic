This homework assignment was a lot of fun and I got inspiration from my two young sons who are 5 and 7.  They love watching epic fails on youtube and my wife and I enjoy listening to them crack up at such funny moments of life caught on camera.  We all make goofy mistakes and failing is often when we learn the most...and sometimes laugh the most
